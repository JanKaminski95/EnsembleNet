# This is the repository describing our idea of Ensemble network.

We focus on differences within the data, where we can distinguish what we call *data modes*. The __main__.py file consists of a script which performs a cross_validation training for both *data modes* present in our data. In addition we calculate the F1 score over 4 test images which were segmented by our ensemble. 

This work has been submitted as a short paper to MIDL 2021 conference where it was peer reviewed and accepted as a poster.
